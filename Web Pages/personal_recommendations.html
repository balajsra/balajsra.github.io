            <h2><a name="Fences" href="https://www.stardock.com/products/fences/" target="_blank">Fences</a></h2>
            <h3>Platform: Windows</h3>
            <p>
                Fences is a desktop management software that allows you to group your desktop icons into "fences".
                These fences can be rolled up so they are tucked away neatly into a corner, allowing you to view
                your desktop wallpaper while still being able to access your shortcuts when you need to.
                I really like Fences because it keeps my desktop clutter-free and I get to look at my amazing
                wallpaper (see <a href="#Wallpaper Engine">Wallpaper Engine</a>). I purchased Fences on
                <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/607380/Fences/" target="_blank">Steam</a>, but you
                can also get it directly from <a href="https://www.stardock.com/products/fences/" target="_blank">Stardock's website</a>.
                Would definitely recommend getting it if you have a cluttered desktop.
            </p>

            <h2><a name="Start10" href="https://www.stardock.com/products/start10/" target="_blank">Start10</a></h2>
            <h3>Platform: Windows</h3>
            <p>
                I wasn't actually interested in Start10 when I first got it. I got it in a
                <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/bundle/3675/Fences__Start10/" target="_blank">bundle</a> with <a href="#Fences">Fences</a>.
                The gist of Start10 is that it allows you to customize the way your taskbar looks and the style of start menu
                you would like. The options are Windows 7, Windows 10, or Modern. Windows 7 has the classic
                searchbar and list of applications. Windows 10 has the list of programs and start menu "tiles"
                introduced in Windows 10. Modern style is a bit of a hybrid. It has the application list from
                Windows 7, but the theme looks more like Windows 10. I personally prefer Windows 10 style because
                of the "tiles" that easily let you launch your favorite apps. I wouldn't necessarily recommend
                getting Start10 on its own as I don't see much value in it, but it is a nice addition if you have
                ever wanted to change the look of your taskbar or start menu.

            <h3>Platform: Windows</h3>
            <p>
                Wallpaper Engine is amongst my favorite programs on this list. If you have ever seen live wallpapers on phones
                and thought "can I get that on my PC?"", this is the program for you. At a regular price of $3.99, I
                cannot recommend this enough. Fair warning, this will drain your battery and RAM if you plan on running
                it at its highest settings with animations and other compute heavy settings. I usually run this on my laptop
                so the wallpaper is static when unplugged, but animated and reactive when plugged in. There are some memory
                saving options that can pause the program when another program is in full-screen and in-focus to improve
                battery life and performance.

            <p>
                This is my current favorite productivity app. I use it to keep track of things like homework, personal tasks,
                gift ideas, shopping lists, personal wish lists, upcoming video games, etc. I previously used Trello and
                google keep to track tasks and random bits of information, but Notion has been a game changer. While the
                full experience is locked behind a paywall, you can try it out for free if you have a university (.edu) email.
                If you haven't already, I would suggest giving it a try. Use this

            <h3>Platform: Windows</h3>
            <p>
                Have you ever wondered if there was an app to combine all of your messaging apps into 1? Well, Clatter
                is the answer. I used to keep multiple tabs and programs open so I could see all of my messaging services
                at once, but with Clatter, they are all neatly packaged in one application. Any messaging service with a web
                app can be accessed through Clatter. Give it a try, I'm sure you will enjoy it as much as I do.

            <h3>Platform: Windows</h3>
            <p>
                Chocolatey is Windows's answer to Homebrew. It is essentially a package manager that allows you to easily track
                and upgrade/install/uninstall programs on Windows. My process when installing apps is to check if there is a
                Windows app on the Microsoft Store. If not, I check Chocolatey. More times than not, it's available there.
                You can easily install any programs you need via command prompt and avoid the tedious installation wizard.

            <p>
                This is my preferred Podcast app. I have it on my Android phone and I use the Windows app on my desktop
                and laptop. I purchased the web app and android app prior to the new "subscription" model that Pocket Casts
                has implemented. While I don't agree with this new pay structure, I appreciate that they have implemented a
                free tier that has the majority of features that most people will need.

                (tip 29). All relevant information on what apps to download and a fix for a login issue can be found in the
                reddit post. The gist of the app is that it removes ads from YouTube on your android phone and you can play
                music while your screen is off for free.

                This is the best PDF editor/reader I have found that doesn't require a paid subscription (unlike Adobe) for

                Similar to <a href="#YouTube Vanced">YouTube Vanced</a>, this app removes ads from YouTube. The main difference

            <h2><a name="Microsoft Edge" href="https://www.microsoftedgeinsider.com/en-us/download" target="_blank">Microsoft Edge (Chromium)</a></h2>
            <h3>Platform: Windows, macOS, iOS, Android</h3>
            <p>
                At the time of writing, Microsoft Edge (Chromium) doesn't have an official release yet. Latest reports suggest January 15th, 2020 as the official release
                date. You can still download a Beta, Development, or Canary build of the new web browser from the <a href="https://www.microsoftedgeinsider.com/en-us/" target="_blank">Edge Insider site</a>.
                I have been using the development build of the new Microsoft Edge since around June 2019 and have generally enjoyed it.
                It will be very familiar for those coming from Chrome since it is also based on <a href="https://www.chromium.org/" target="_blank">Chromium</a>.
                The main reason I like it is for its speed and reduced RAM usage. I haven't done any official tests comparing performance, but it
                subjectively seems more responsive. Additionally, most if not all Chrome extensions can be used on the new Edge, so that
                should help ease the transition for those who can't live without them. One of Microsoft's main selling points for
                the new Edge is privacy features. Overall, there are still a few issues I have encountered like links in google searches
                not opening properly, but I'm sure these will be ironed out by the official release date.

            <h2>Desktop PC</h2>
            A full list of my desktop PC build components can be found on <a href="https://pcpartpicker.com/user/sr98vn/saved/#view=dv8LJx" target="_blank">PCPartPicker</a>.
            My current build has stayed largely the same from when I first built it, with the exception of the peripherals and monitors.
            I have upgraded my keyboard, mouse, and speakers over the past couple of years as I found deals.

            <h2>Laptop</h2>
            <h3>Model: HP Spectre x360 15"</h3>
            <h3>CPU: Intel i7-7500U</h3>
            <h3>GPU: NVIDIA GeForce 940MX</h3>
            <h3>RAM: 16 GB</h3>
            <p>
                My main laptop use case is for school. I wanted a touchscreen so I could take digital written notes in class and
                I needed a good processor and dedicated graphics card for CAD software and for general programming applications.
                I landed on the HP Specture x360 because it had a great balance of specs, amazing display, touch screen, and very
                nice typing experience for a reasonable price. I was initially leaning towards a Razer Blade or Microsoft's Surface Book.
                The former would be great for my use case and for gaming, but it isn't great for taking handwritten digital notes.
                The latter is similar to the Spectre in regards to specs, but has a favorable display ratio. The main reason I chose
                against it in the end was the high price relative to the Spectre. I was able to get very comparable specs for a much
                lower price with the spectre.
            </p>

            <h2>Tablet</h2>
            <h3>Model: Microsoft Surface Go</h3>
            <h3>CPU: Intel Pentium 4415Y</h3>
            <h3>RAM: 4 GB</h3>
            <p>
                The Surface Go is primarily used as a secondary-device and tablet. I use it for media consumption and occasional e-book
                reading. It is by no means powerful enough to act as my primary device, but I like it as a secondary device that
                I will occasionally use.
            </p>

            <h2>Phone</h2>
            <h3>Model: Samsung Galaxy S10+</h3>
            <p>
                Got the Galaxy S10+ on sale on Amazon's Prime Day. My previous phone was a Pixel 2XL which I really liked, but I decided
                to switch to a Galaxy after the Pixel 3 was a bit of a disappointment and the Pixel 4 wouldn't come out until later in the year.
                Other phones I considered, but ultimately decided against were the OnePlus 7 Pro and Samsung Galaxy Note 9. In retrospect,
                I would have waited to replace my Pixel 2XL until the Galaxy Note 10+ came out and the price dropped down to something reasonable.
                However, I am happy with my decision as is.
            </p>

            <h2>Watch</h2>
            <h3>Model: Samsung Galaxy Watch</h3>
            <p>
                I previously had a Moto 360 Sport smartwatch, but the performance was extremely disappointing. After looking at other
                Android wear devices, I didn't feel that another compelling watch on the level of the Apple Watch for iPhones existed.
                Thus, I decided to switch to the Galaxy watch. My primary impressions of Tizen OS vs Android Wear is the lack of
                supported apps. I have found that this really isn't that big of a deal as it has great media controls for your phone
                and the amazing rotating bezel interface. This is by far the superior input method for watches and I feel that
                all watches should have some variant of this. Overall, the performance is great and I have come to appreciate
                Samsung's brand of apps for my phone and watch.

            <p>
                As a New England Patriot's fan (most because of Tom Brady), I really enjoy this (perhaps too Boston-centric) sports podcast.
                Bill Simmons grew up in the New England area and supports all of the Boston teams, although he currently lives in LA.
                I enjoy his conversations with friends and family about the week's events in sports, generally focused on NFL and NBA.
                He occasionally has celebrity guests and sometimes brings guests on to talk about TV and movies.

            <h3><a href="https://pca.st/footballweekly" target="_blank">Football Weekly (The Guardian)</a></h3>
            <p>
                I love the light-hearted and sometimes comedic news and analysis of Premier League (and others) matches. The rotating
                cast of football journalists and long-time hosts are thoroughly enjoyable to listen to every week.
                Definitely recommend this podcast for any football (soccer) fans.

            <h2>Video Games</h2>
            <h3><a href="https://pca.st/bombcast" target="_blank">Giant Bombcast (Giant Bomb)</a></h3>
            <p>
               The Giant Bombcast is a great podcast for video game fans. They discuss video game news, latest releases, and sometimes
               stuff completely unrelated. Very fun to listen to throughout the week as each episode is pretty long.

                The Vergecast is perhaps my favorite podcast of any genre. The hosts discuss the week's tech news and other
                nerdy topics as well as interviews with tech leaders. Cannot recommend this enough.

            <h2>Comedy</h2>
            <h3><a href="https://pca.st/nprwaitwait" target="_blank">Wait Wait... Don't Tell Me! (NPR)</a></h3>
            <p>
                This is my favorite news/comedy podcast. I love hearing about the week's wacky stories and the rotating
                panel of comedians' opinons on world events.

            <h2>News</h2>
            <h3><a href="https://pca.st/thedaily" target="_blank">The Daily (The New York Times)</a></h3>
            <p>
                My go to for the major news events of the day (as implied by the name). It's ready every weekday by 6 AM and
                generally doesn't run longer than 30 minutes. Great way to start the day.

            <h2>History</h2>
            <h3><a href="https://pca.st/hardcorehist" target="_blank">Dan Carlin's Hardcore History (Dan Carlin)</a></h3>
            <p>
                This is long-form historical discussion and analysis. If you are interested in diving deep into historical
                events from the perspective of someone who knows how to tell a story, this is the podcast for you. Episodes
                are generally 4 to 5 hours long and aren't released very often as they require an enormous amount of research.
            </p>

            <h3><a href="https://pca.st/lmm1" target="_blank">Throughline (NPR)</a></h3>
            <p>
                The premise of Throughline is exploring how we can look at the past to understand the present. The hosts are
                awesome and always find very interesting stories in the past relating to current events that help put
                things in perspective.
            </p>

            <h2>Miscellaneous</h2>
            <h3><a href="https://pca.st/invisibilia" target="_blank">Invisibilia (NPR)</a></h3>
            <p>
                I'm not entirely sure how to describe this podcast. According to the podcast description, Invisibilia is about
                the unseeable forces that control human behavior and shake our ideas, beliefs, and assumptions. Definitely very
                interesting and different from most of the other podcasts I listen to.
