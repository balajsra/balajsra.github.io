                            include some of my thoughts on why I made certain decisions (e.g. website hosting) to help anyone else looking to build a website from
                            scratch. You can follow development of my website and make suggestions on <a href="https://github.com/balajsra/balajsra.github.io" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.

                            This website was designed in HTML with some CSS for styling. In it's current state, I have not used any component libraries (such as
                            <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/" target="_blank">bootstrap</a>), but I do have plans to implement more responsive and dynamic features
                            with mobile support when I find the time.

                            <a href="https://domains.google.com/" target="_blank">Google Domains</a> to purchase the <a href="https://sravanbalaji.com/">sravanbalaji.com</a> domain.

                        <p>
                            There are a couple of options I have found for hosting my website (for free). As a U of M student, I am able to create my own UM Web Page hosted on U of M Servers
                            or create a personal site hosted by Google through the <a href="http://google.umich.edu/" target="_blank">U-M Google collaboration</a>. I have not looked into
                            the Google Sites option, but there is <a href="https://support.google.com/sites/" target="_blank">documentation</a> available if you are interested.
                            I originally opted to create my own site and host it on U of M Servers. Information on how to do this can be found on the
                            <a href="http://www.umich.edu/~umweb/how-to/homepage.html" target="_blank">UMICH Information and Technology Services website</a>. Some limitations I found
                            with this were that I would have to manually upload my website files to the afs directory as the SFTP process described did not work for me. Additionally,
                            the domain name for U of M hosted websites take the form <b>http://www-personal.umich.edu/~youruniqname/</b> which is clearly not ideal. You can sort of
                            get around this by enabling <a href="https://support.google.com/domains/answer/4522141?hl=en" target="_blank">web forwarding</a> on Google Domains.
                            All this does is redirect traffic from your custom domain to the U of M domain. This might be ok for you, but I would prefer to have my website show
                            up at the domain I purchased. Per <a href="https://vesikar.com/" target="_blank">Yash Vesikar</a>'s recommendation, I looked into <a href="https://pages.github.com/" target="_blank">GitHub Pages</a>
                            to host my website directly from a GitHub repository. This comes with the added benefit that changes are live as soon as you push them to the <b>master</b> branch
                            of your &lt;username&gt;.github.io repository. I found <a href="https://trentyang.com/how-to-setup-google-domain-for-github-pages/" target="_blank">Trent Yang's post</a>
                            about setting up Google Domains for GitHub pages very useful.

                        <p>
                            When I first made this website, it was implemented in HTML and CSS without the use of a framework. This gave me a lot of custom control over every
                            aspect, but it made some things unnecessarily tedious and difficult. One example of this is the navigation bar. Trying to implement that without
                            a framework is more difficult than it needs to be. Another issue I ran into was compatibility with mobile browsers. Per
                            <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tianhongwen/" target="_blank">Tianhong (Sam) Wen</a>'s recommendation, I looked into
                            <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/" target="_blank">Bootstrap</a>. This has built-in "responsive" classes that can auto adjust
                            the size and placement of elements based on the screen size. It also provides an easy way to implement some cool features
                            like the navbar, accordion-like cards, and a grid layout to easily place images and text around your website's viewport.

                        <p>
                            The easiest way I found to reuse HTML code is via JavaScript as described in
                            <a href="https://www.uvm.edu/~bnelson/computer/javascript/pageheadersandfooters.html" target="_blank">Page Headers And Footers</a>. This is by no
                            means the most elegant or automated, but it was the only method I could get to actually work. If you don't want to go through the hassle of manually
                            removing line breaks, you can use this handy online text converter from <a href="https://www.textfixer.com/tools/remove-line-breaks.php" target="_blank">Text Fixer</a>.

                        <p>
                            I have the latest version of my <a href="portfolio.html#resume">resume</a> stored in a public <a href="https://github.com/balajsra/resume" target="_blank">
                            GitHub repository</a>, but I wanted an easy way to share it directly on my website. This led me to look for ways to embed a PDF in HTML.
                            This works great for local files, but not so great for PDFs stored in a repository. The trick is to get the link to the raw PDF file
                            from GitHub and to use Google Drive PDF Viewer. This is outlined in
