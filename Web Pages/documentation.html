            <h1>Introduction</h1>
            <p>
                My original intention with this page was to simply save useful links so I could refer back to them, but I thought it might be better to
                include some of my thoughts on why I made certain decisions (e.g. website hosting) to help anyone else looking to build a website from
                scratch. You can follow development of my website and make suggestions on <a href="https://github.com/balajsra/balajsra.github.io" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.
                If you have any questions, feel free to <a href="about.html#contact_me">contact me</a>.<br><br>

                This website was designed in HTML with some CSS for styling. In it's current state, I have not used any component libraries (such as
                <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/" target="_blank">bootstrap</a>), but I do have plans to implement more responsive and dynamic features
                with mobile support when I find the time.
            </p>

            <h1>Website Hosting</h1>
            <h2>Purchasing a Domain Name</h2>
            <p>
                Per <a href="https://vesikar.com/" target="_blank">Yash Vesikar</a>'s recommendation, I used
                <a href="https://domains.google.com/" target="_blank">Google Domains</a> to purchase the <a href="https://sravanbalaji.com/">sravanbalaji.com</a> domain.
            </p>

            <h2>Hosting Website</h2>
            <p>
                There are a couple of options I have found for hosting my website (for free). As a U of M student, I am able to create my own UM Web Page hosted on U of M Servers
                or create a personal site hosted by Google through the <a href="http://google.umich.edu/" target="_blank">U-M Google collaboration</a>. I have not looked into
                the Google Sites option, but there is <a href="https://support.google.com/sites/" target="_blank">documentation</a> available if you are interested.
                I originally opted to create my own site and host it on U of M Servers. Information on how to do this can be found on the
                <a href="http://www.umich.edu/~umweb/how-to/homepage.html" target="_blank">UMICH Information and Technology Services website</a>. Some limitations I found
                with this were that I would have to manually upload my website files to the afs directory as the SFTP process described did not work for me. Additionally,
                the domain name for U of M hosted websites take the form <b>http://www-personal.umich.edu/~youruniqname/</b> which is clearly not ideal. You can sort of
                get around this by enabling <a href="https://support.google.com/domains/answer/4522141?hl=en" target="_blank">web forwarding</a> on Google Domains.
                All this does is redirect traffic from your custom domain to the U of M domain. This might be ok for you, but I would prefer to have my website show
                up at the domain I purchased. Per <a href="https://vesikar.com/" target="_blank">Yash Vesikar</a>'s recommendation, I looked into <a href="https://pages.github.com/" target="_blank">GitHub Pages</a>
                to host my website directly from a GitHub repository. This comes with the added benefit that changes are live as soon as you push them to the <b>master</b> branch
                of your &lt;username&gt;.github.io repository. I found <a href="https://trentyang.com/how-to-setup-google-domain-for-github-pages/" target="_blank">Trent Yang's post</a>
                about setting up Google Domain for GitHub pages very useful.

            <h1>HTML / CSS Features</h1>
            <h2>Navigation & Subnavigation Bar</h2>
            <p>
                I created the navigation bar you see at the top of this page based on the example code provided in
                <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/howto/tryit.asp?filename=tryhow_css_subnav" target="_blank">Subnav/dropdown menu inside a Navigation Bar</a>.
            </p>

            <h2>Common Page Headers and Footers</h2>
            <p>
                The easiest way I found to re-use HTML code is via JavaScript as described in
                <a href="https://www.uvm.edu/~bnelson/computer/javascript/pageheadersandfooters.html" target="_blank">Page Headers And Footers</a>.
            </p>

            <h1>Color Scheme</h1>
            <p>
                I used the color scheme outlined in <a href="https://vpcomm.umich.edu/brand/style-guide/design-principles/colors" target="_blank">University of Michigan - Style Guide: Colors</a>.
            </p>

            <h1>Inspiration</h1>
            <p>
                Content, design, and implementation were inspired by the following sources
                <ul>
                    <li><a href="http://www-personal.umich.edu/~prakashk/" target="_blank">Prakash Kumar's Website</a></li>
