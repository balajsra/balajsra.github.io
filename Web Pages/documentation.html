        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>
            This website is hosted on U of M Servers. If you are a UMICH student<br>
            and you are interested in creating and hosting a personal website<br>
            on U of M servers, read this guide.<br><br>
            
            All necessary information can be found on the <a href="http://www.umich.edu/~umweb/how-to/homepage.html">UMICH Information and Technology Services website</a>.<br>
            To get started, you have 2 options:
            <ol>
                <li>Personal Site hosted by Google</li>
                <li>UM Web Page hosted on U of M Servers</li>
            </ol>
            This website was created via option 2 because I wanted to learn how to make my own HTML pages.<br>
