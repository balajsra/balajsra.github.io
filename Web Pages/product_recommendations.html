        <h1>Software</h1>
        <h2><a name="Fences" href="https://www.stardock.com/products/fences/" target="_blank">Fences</a></h2>
        <h3>Platform: Windows</h3>
        <p>
            Fences is a desktop management software that allows you to group your desktop icons into "fences".<br>
            These fences can be rolled up so they are tucked away neatly into a corner, allowing you to view<br>
            your desktop wallpaper while still being able to access your shortcuts when you need to.<br>
            I really like Fences because it keeps my desktop clutter-free and I get to look at my amazing<br>
            wallpaper (see <a href="#Wallpaper Engine">Wallpaper Engine</a>). I purchased Fences on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/607380/Fences/" target="_blank">Steam</a>, but you can also get it directly<br>
            from <a href="https://www.stardock.com/products/fences/" target="_blank">Stardock's website</a>. Would definitely recommend getting it if you have a cluttered desktop.

        <h2><a href="https://www.stardock.com/products/start10/" target="_blank">Start10</a></h2>
        <h3>Platform: Windows</h3>
        <p>
            I wasn't actually interested in Start10 when I first got it. I got it in a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/bundle/3675/Fences__Start10/" target="_blank">bundle</a> with <a href="#Fences">Fences</a>. The gist of<br>
            Start10 is that it allows you to customize the way your taskbar looks and the style of start menu<br>
            you would like. The options are Windows 7, Windows 10, or Modern. Windows 7 has the classic<br>
            searchbar and list of applications. Windows 10 has the list of programs and start menu "tiles"<br>
            introduced in Windows 10. Modern style is a bit of a hybrid. It has the application list from<br>
            Windows 7, but the theme looks more like Windows 10. I personally prefer Windows 10 style because<br>
            of the "tiles" that easily let you launch your favorite apps. I wouldn't necessarily recommend<br>
            getting Start10 on its own as I don't see much value in it, but it is a nice addition if you have<br>
            ever wanted to change the look of your taskbar or start menu.

        <h2><a name="Wallpaper Engine" href="https://www.wallpaperengine.io/" target="_blank">Wallpaper Engine</a></h2>
        <h3>Platform: Windows</h3>
        <p>
            Wallpaper Engine is amongst my favorite programs on this list. If you have ever seen live wallpapers on phones<br>
            and thought "can I get that on my PC?"", this is the program for you. At a regular price of $3.99, I<br>
            cannot recommend this enough. Fair warning, this will drain your battery and RAM if you plan on running<br>
            it at its highest settings with animations and other compute heavy settings. I usually run this on my laptop<br>
            so the wallpaper is static when unplugged, but animated and reactive when plugged in. There are some memory<br>
            saving options that can pause the program when another program is in full-screen and in-focus to improve <br>
            battery life and performance.
