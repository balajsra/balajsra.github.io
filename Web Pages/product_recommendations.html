        <h1>Software</h1>
        <h2><a name="Fences" href="https://www.stardock.com/products/fences/" target="_blank">Fences</a></h2>
        <h3>Platform: Windows</h3>
        <p>
            Fences is a desktop management software that allows you to group your desktop icons into "fences".<br>
            These fences can be rolled up so they are tucked away neatly into a corner, allowing you to view<br>
            your desktop wallpaper while still being able to access your shortcuts when you need to.<br>
            I really like Fences because it keeps my desktop clutter-free and I get to look at my amazing<br>
            wallpaper (see <a href="#Wallpaper Engine">Wallpaper Engine</a>). I purchased Fences on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/607380/Fences/" target="_blank">Steam</a>, but you can also get it directly<br>
            from <a href="https://www.stardock.com/products/fences/" target="_blank">Stardock's website</a>. Would definitely recommend getting it if you have a cluttered desktop.
        </p>

        <h2><a name="Start10" href="https://www.stardock.com/products/start10/" target="_blank">Start10</a></h2>
        <h3>Platform: Windows</h3>
        <p>
            I wasn't actually interested in Start10 when I first got it. I got it in a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/bundle/3675/Fences__Start10/" target="_blank">bundle</a> with <a href="#Fences">Fences</a>. The gist of<br>
            Start10 is that it allows you to customize the way your taskbar looks and the style of start menu<br>
            you would like. The options are Windows 7, Windows 10, or Modern. Windows 7 has the classic<br>
            searchbar and list of applications. Windows 10 has the list of programs and start menu "tiles"<br>
            introduced in Windows 10. Modern style is a bit of a hybrid. It has the application list from<br>
            Windows 7, but the theme looks more like Windows 10. I personally prefer Windows 10 style because<br>
            of the "tiles" that easily let you launch your favorite apps. I wouldn't necessarily recommend<br>
            getting Start10 on its own as I don't see much value in it, but it is a nice addition if you have<br>
            ever wanted to change the look of your taskbar or start menu.

        <h2><a name="Wallpaper Engine" href="https://www.wallpaperengine.io/" target="_blank">Wallpaper Engine</a></h2>
        <h3>Platform: Windows</h3>
        <p>
            Wallpaper Engine is amongst my favorite programs on this list. If you have ever seen live wallpapers on phones<br>
            and thought "can I get that on my PC?"", this is the program for you. At a regular price of $3.99, I<br>
            cannot recommend this enough. Fair warning, this will drain your battery and RAM if you plan on running<br>
            it at its highest settings with animations and other compute heavy settings. I usually run this on my laptop<br>
            so the wallpaper is static when unplugged, but animated and reactive when plugged in. There are some memory<br>
            saving options that can pause the program when another program is in full-screen and in-focus to improve <br>
            battery life and performance.

        <h2><a name="Notion" href="https://www.notion.so/?r=542c7e5df78d4ff0bf5417dd397f26b8" target="_blank">Notion</a></h2>
        <h3>Platform: Web App, Mac, Windows, iOS, Android</h3>
        <p>
            This is my current favorite productivity app. I use it to keep track of things like homework, personal tasks,<br>
            gift ideas, shopping lists, personal wish lists, upcoming video games, etc. I previously used Trello and<br>
            google keep to track tasks and random bits of information, but Notion has been a game changer. While the<br>
            full experience is locked behind a paywall, you can try it out for free if you have a university (.edu) email.<br>
            If you haven't already, I would suggest giving it a try. Use this <a href="https://www.notion.so/?r=542c7e5df78d4ff0bf5417dd397f26b8" target="_blank">referral link</a> to get some free credit on your<br>
            account to use if you decide to use any of the paid tier.

        <h2><a name="Clatter" href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/clatter/9nps35br12q8" target="_blank">Clatter</a></h2>
        <h3>Platform: Windows</h3>
        <p>
            Have you ever wondered if there was an app to combine all of your messaging apps into 1? Well, Clatter<br>
            is the answer. I used to keep multiple tabs and programs open so I could see all of my messaging services<br>
            at once, but with Clatter, they are all neatly packaged in one application. Any messaging service with a web<br>
            app can be accessed through Clatter. Give it a try, I'm sure you will enjoy it as much as I do.

        <h2><a name="Chocolatey" href="https://chocolatey.org/" target="_blank">Chocolatey</a></h2>
        <h3>Platform: Windows</h3>
        <p>
            Chocolatey is Windows's answer to Homebrew. It is essentially a package manager that allows you to easily track<br>
            and upgrade/install/uninstall programs on Windows. My process when installing apps is to check if there is a<br>
            Windows app on the Microsoft Store. If not, I check Chocolatey. More times than not, it's available there.<br>
            You can easily install any programs you need via command prompt and avoid the tedious installation wizard.
        </p>

        <h2><a name="Pocket Casts" href="https://www.pocketcasts.com/" target="_blank">Pocket Casts</a></h2>
        <h3>Platform: Web App, iOS, Android</h3>
        <p>
            This is my preferred Podcast app. I have it on my Android phone and I use the Windows app on my desktop<br>
            and laptop. I purchased the web app and android app prior to the new "subscription" model that Pocket Casts<br>
            has implemented. While I don't agree with this new pay structure, I appreciate that they have implemented a<br>
            free tier that has the majority of features that most people will need.
        </p>

        <h2><a name="YouTube Vanced" href="https://vanced.app/" target="_blank">YouTube Vanced</a></h2>
        <h3>Platform: Android</h3>
        <p>
            I discovered this on a MEGA PRO TIPS post on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/galaxys10/comments/bg2bb2/mega_pro_tips_make_the_most_of_your_s10_settings/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x">r/galaxys10</a> (tip 29). All relevant information on what apps to<br>
            download and a fix for a login issue can be found in the reddit post. The gist of the app is that it removes<br>
            ads from YouTube on your android phone and you can play music while your screen is off for free.
        </p>

        <h2><a name="Xodo" href="https://xodo.com/" target="_blank">Xodo</a></h2>
        <h3>Platform: Web App, iOS, Android, Windows</h3>
        <p>
            This is the best PDF editor/reader I have found that doesn't require a paid subscription (unlike Adobe) for<br>
            all of its features. You can easily write/edit, fill out forms, and add digital signatures. All for free.
        </p>

        <h2><a name="myTube!" href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/mytube/9wzdncrcwf3l" target="_blank">myTube!</a></h2>
        <h3>Platform: Windows</h3>
        <p>
            Similar to <a href="#YouTube Vanced">YouTube Vanced</a>, this app removes ads from YouTube. The main difference<br>
            here is that myTube! is a Windows app rather than an Android app.

        <h1>Hardware</h1>
        <h2>Desktop PC</h2>
        A full list of my desktop PC build components can be found on <a href="https://pcpartpicker.com/user/sr98vn/saved/#view=dv8LJx" target="_blank">PCPartPicker</a>.<br>
        My current build has stayed largely the same from when I first built it, with the exception of the peripherals and monitors.<br>
        I have upgraded my keyboard, mouse, and speakers over the past couple of years as I found deals.

        <h2>Laptop</h2>
        <h3>Model: HP Spectre x360 15"</h3>
        <h3>CPU: Intel i7-7500U</h3>
        <h3>GPU: NVIDIA GeForce 940MX</h3>
        <h3>RAM: 16 GB</h3>
        <p>
            My main laptop use case is for school. I wanted a touchscreen so I could take digital written notes in class and<br>
            I needed a good processor and dedicated graphics card for CAD software and for general programming applications.<br>
            I landed on the HP Specture x360 because it had a great balance of specs, amazing display, touch screen, and very<br>
            nice typing experience for a reasonable price. I was initially leaning towards a Razer Blade or Microsoft's Surface Book.<br>
            The former would be great for my use case and for gaming, but it isn't great for taking handwritten digital notes.<br>
            The latter is similar to the Spectre in regards to specs, but has a favorable display ratio. The main reason I chose<br>
            against it in the end was the high price relative to the Spectre. I was able to get very comparable specs for a much<br>
            lower price with the spectre.
        </p>

        <h2>Tablet</h2>
        <h3>Model: Microsoft Surface Go</h3>
        <h3>CPU: Intel Pentium 4415Y</h3>
        <h3>RAM: 4 GB</h3>
        <p>
            The Surface Go is primarily used as a secondary-device and tablet. I use it for media consumption and occasional e-book<br>
            reading. It is by no means powerful enough to act as my primary device, but I like it as a secondary device that<br>
            I will occasionally use.
        </p>

        <h2>Phone</h2>
        <h3>Model: Samsung Galaxy S10+</h3>
        <p>
            Got the Galaxy S10+ on sale on Amazon's Prime Day. My previous phone was a Pixel 2XL which I really liked, but I decided<br>
            to switch to a Galaxy after the Pixel 3 was a bit of a disappointment and the Pixel 4 wouldn't come out until later in the year.<br>
            Other phones I considered, but ultimately decided against were the OnePlus 7 Pro and Samsung Galaxy Note 9. In retrospect,<br>
            I would have waited to replace my Pixel 2XL until the Galaxy Note 10+ came out and the price dropped down to something reasonable.<br>
            However, I am happy with my decision as is.
        </p>

        <h2>Watch</h2>
        <h3>Model: Samsung Galaxy Watch</h3>
        <p>
            I previously had a Moto 360 Sport smartwatch, but the performance was extremely disappointing. After looking at other<br>
            Android wear devices, I didn't feel that another compelling watch on the level of the Apple Watch for iPhones existed.<br>
            Thus, I decided to switch to the Galaxy watch. My primary impressions of Tizen OS vs Android Wear is the lack of<br>
            supported apps. I have found that this really isn't that big of a deal as it has great media controls for your phone<br>
            and the amazing rotating bezel interface. This is by far the superior input method for watches and I feel that<br>
            all watches should have some variant of this. Overall, the performance is great and I have come to appreciate<br>
            Samsung's brand of apps for my phone and watch.
